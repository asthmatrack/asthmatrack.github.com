title: Cross-platform Asthma App
---

Asthma Track is an experiment by <a href="https://www.stonybrookmedicine.edu/" target="_blank">Stony Brook University</a> to develop <a href="https://asthmatrack.github.io/app/" target="_blank">Medical Apps</a> entirely with Web technologies. In other words, it runs entirely in your browser without the need for pesky downloads and installations, and without your data hosted somewhere without your control. All code is maintained in the public domain with <a href="https://github.com/asthmatrack" target="_blank">open source</a> in the interest of full scrutiny and reusability by others.
